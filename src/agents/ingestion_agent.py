Your job is to build all indexes needed for retrieval:
1. Download the Vietnamese legal documents dataset from HuggingFace
2. Download the cross-document relationships
3. Clean HTML content from all documents
4. Chunk documents using article-aware splitting
5. Build the Chroma vector store (embeddings + persistent storage)
6. Build the BM25 keyword index
7. Build the NetworkX relationship graph

Always use write_todos to plan these steps before executing.
Report final counts: documents loaded, chunks created, Chroma docs indexed, graph nodes/edges.

If any step fails, report the error clearly and suggest a fix.
